JWT-Json Web Token
Server side resources which we access through api ->we can get access control or say can keep more secure
JWT-Encrypted string
Data which is encrypted to generate JWT->TO store/repsnt that data the content-type/format we use is called Json
Json-data store/rreprsnt format->keys associate->keys->any values(int,bool etc.)/subjson docs/nested dstr also
Encryption of Json->Lib of each prog. lang./plugin
Encryption key needed to encrypted
How JWT Works-> eg Bus/Train pass validity and expiry

Implementation Steps:
Client                                                       Server
Req.1) Login Req(uname,pwd)  ------------------->If validated > eg. uid:14 ,role:admin +(EXPIRY of JWT)+ Encryption key= JWT 
                                                   
Store JWT                    <--------------------JWT(Encrypted String)

Req.2)
.      ----------------------------------------->JWT->(eg. ecom web user accessing prev orders)
Req.n)


Not all APIs need JWT auth,accessible to everyone,apis which can be accessed via login only for that only we write code for JWT auth execution.

__________________________________________________________________
Authentication(ready to access resources not accessed yet) & Authorization(check permission to acccess particular resource to particular user role)
Eg. Youtube ->watch(Guest user)
       User ->Subscribe/like/commnt etc.
       Creator->to upload videos
